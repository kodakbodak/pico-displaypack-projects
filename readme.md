This is a simple project I am working on for fun. It uses a Raspbery Pi Pico with the pimoroni PicoDisplay. Just a little collection of WIP projects for it. As I learn more about MicroPython and the display library, this will grow.


THE PROJECTS:

Winning Button:

Winning Button is a game of chance. Click the correct button on your display to see if you win! Name is subject to change.

Decision Maker:

Ever wanted to flip a coin for something? Maybe play a round of Rock, Paper, Scissors? Perhaps you'd like to pick a random number betwen 1 and 100? And who could forget the classic 6-sided dice, now in (really janky) digital form! All this and (not actually any) more is available in this Python file. 

USAGE:

Display:

IDE:

If you're looking at this project, then you probably know what you're doing. But just in case, I have been using Thonny to work with the Pico and everything is super easy. These have been tested using Thonny on Arch Linux (btw) but should be no problem on other OS.

INSTALL THONNY:

Arch Linux

    yay -S thonny

Debian/Ubuntu

    sudo apt install python3-tk thonny

RHEL/Fedora

    sudo dnf install thonny
